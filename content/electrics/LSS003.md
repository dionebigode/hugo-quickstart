# LSS003-The JFET Mixer/Power Amp

###### tags: electrics, projects

As steps to create a development enviroment, I made a simple mixer using the [Synthesizer Build part-17: MIXER and PASSIVE ATTENUATOR from Eddy Bergman](https://www.eddybergman.com/2020/01/synthesizer-build-part-17-mixer-and.html) and then a PSU mashing up a few ideas like [Synthesizer Build part-1: SYMMETRICAL POWER SUPPLY](https://www.eddybergman.com/2019/09/symmetrical-powersupply.html) and the [MOFOS Wall Wart Power Supply](http://musicfromouterspace.com/analogsynth_new/WALLWARTSUPPLY/WALLWARTSUPPLY.php) even finding some stripboard designs over at /r/synthdiy like [this one](https://old.reddit.com/r/synthdiy/comments/hi01rs/mfos_power_supply_on_stripboard/)

The next logical step was to make an power amp to drive a speaker unit, therefore, having a solid enviroment for development and testing. 

Eventually I found the Ruby Amp, a 386-based 9V baterry amp, as a guitar amplifier. My first contact was with the [runoffgroove website](https://www.runoffgroove.com/ruby.html), which atracted my attention for not using Op Amps for input buffering - acording to the project page, "*a MPF102 FET is specified for the buffer, though a 2N5457 will offer similar results*" which looked interesting to me, since I have a bunch of 2N5457 laying around

What's interesting about this amp is that it's original permutation was the Smokey Amp, a guitar amp you could build in a cigarette pack, the guys from ElectrosMash have an excelent page analysing the details of both the Smokey and the [Ruby amp](https://www.electrosmash.com/ruby-amp-analysis)

Interesting enough, there's a section on said analysis that got my attention: 

"1.1 Input Buffer

The input buffer is a basic JFET common drain transistor amplifier (this part of the circuit was probably inspired by the Jack Orman designs)(..)

(..) The input impedance is determined by the value of R1 and it is 1M5. (..) "

Which meant that I could have an buffered input as high as I would need, without having to worry about impedance. Googling around for Jack Orman, I found his webpage which has a super interesting page on [Basic Buffers](http://www.muzique.com/lab/buffers.htm), and this other one by Beavis Audio, [also talking about Buffers with more references](http://beavisaudio.com/techpages/buffers/). 

This again, confirmed me the idea of using a transistor as an input buffer. But I'm a little chicken shit about transistors, it wasn't something I saw in detail at college, and most of the projects I've made usually don't need them, so they are alien components for me.

I asked around [/r/diyaudio](https://old.reddit.com/r/diyaudio/comments/12ixohl/im_designing_a_small_mixerpower_amp_can_i_just/) for advice which led me to search for 'discrete audio mixer' instead of 'transistor audio mixer' - getting to links like this [Discrete (Transistors) Audio Mixer](https://freecircuitdiagram.com/3517-discrete-transistors-audio-mixer/) which uses non JFET NPN transistors and this other [Single Transistor Audio Mixer Circuit](https://circuitdigest.com/electronic-circuits/single-transistor-audio-mixer-circuit) which seems to use a NPN transistor to sum signals, meaning, I could use a single transistor per input channel as a buffer, and then another one to sum all chanlles before fowarding it to the Ruby Amp

Also I should thankt /u/i_am_blacklite for giving me a [solid path to understand transistors more, and also by detailing how this design would be a good one](https://old.reddit.com/r/diyaudio/comments/12ixohl/im_designing_a_small_mixerpower_amp_can_i_just/jga9lm4/).

This is the design I ended up doing, my first copy and paste/not sure what am I doing but it should work design:

I quickly breadboarded it using only two channels and proceded to mix some daft punk and a 40106 oscillator that was already ready on my workbench

And it worked! The final signal over the speakers wasn't as loud when I connected the input signal into a single transistor, so maybe I screwed something over during the process, but honestly? I do not care. I'm just so happy that it worked. There's a lot of noise, and the sound is obviously filtered because of the circuit. I wouldn't recommend anyone soldering this, but it was a nice exercise.
